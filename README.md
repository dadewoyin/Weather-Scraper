# Weather-Scraper
A website made with PHP, AJAX, and jQuery to tell users the weather forecast in a city of their choice.

Devoid of my school work, I've been learning different skills so I can build different web apps for companies, creatives, and to simply make people's lifes easier. Exercising some of the things I've learned from my studies, I created this website.

The website can be viewed at http://176.32.230.42/davidade.com/
