# Weather-Scraper
A website made with PHP, AJAX, and jQuery tecnologies to tell users the weather forecast in a city of their choice.

Completely devoid of my school work at Baruch college, I've been teaching myself different website technologies in hopes of joining a team where I can build different web apps for companies, creatives, and to simply make people's lifes easier. Exercising some of the things I've learned from my independent studies, I created this website.

The website can be viewed at http://176.32.230.42/davidade.com/
